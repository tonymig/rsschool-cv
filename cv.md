3. I'm a curious person, like to learn new technical and improve existing skills, I passionately strive to do everything well, honest with me and other people. I wish to be able to create amazing and functional web applications. I’m self-developing all the time, so I want to join and become part of the team, because this is a great opportunity to expand my knowledge in the field of web development and improve my English. And I believe that I can study myself, because I developed some interesting things without any outside help
